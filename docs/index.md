## Problem

Armenian artists, known for their rich and culturally significant work, face challenges in showcasing and selling their art to a global audience. Despite the increasing demand for unique and authentic artistic creations, there is no dedicated online platform that effectively bridges the gap between Armenian artists and international buyers. A well-designed and appealing digital storefront could offer immense opportunities for these artists, enabling them to expand their reach and thrive in the global art market. However, the key challenge lies in identifying the most effective website design that captivates customers and encourages them to interact, browse, and make purchases.

## Solution

To address this challenge, we have developed a Bayesian A/B testing tool specifically for comparing various design options of an art store website. Unlike traditional A/B testing methods, which rely on fixed sample sizes and often take longer to yield actionable results, Bayesian testing updates probabilities in real-time. This allows for a dynamic evaluation process, enabling us to identify the design that resonates most with users more efficiently. By tracking and analyzing customer behavior, such as the buttons they click and their navigation patterns, the tool offers valuable insights into user engagement and preferences. Furthermore, its adaptive nature ensures that once sufficient data is collected, the tool prioritizes showing the most effective design variant to new customers, enhancing their overall experience.

## Expected Outcomes

The implementation of this tool will result in several impactful outcomes. Firstly, it will provide users with both visual and quantitative insights into customer behavior, helping website managers understand how visitors interact with different design variants. This data-driven approach will not only identify the best-performing design but also uncover trends and preferences that can guide broader marketing and product strategies. Over time, the tool's adaptive mechanism will ensure that the most effective design is prominently displayed, driving higher engagement and conversion rates. Beyond the immediate benefits of design optimization, the tool has the potential to build a competitive edge by creating a more engaging and personalized user experience. By continuously improving the website based on customer feedback, Armenian artists will have a platform that not only showcases their talent but also fosters stronger connections with a global audience.
