## **Problem**  

Armenian artists, renowned for their **rich and culturally significant work**, face challenges in **showcasing and selling their art** to a **global audience**. Despite the growing demand for **unique and authentic artistic creations**, there is **no dedicated online platform** effectively bridging the gap between Armenian artists and **international buyers**.  

A **well-designed and appealing digital storefront** could create immense opportunities for these artists, allowing them to **expand their reach** and thrive in the **global art market**. However, the main challenge is **identifying the most effective website design** that captivates customers and **encourages interaction**, **browsing**, and **purchases**.
